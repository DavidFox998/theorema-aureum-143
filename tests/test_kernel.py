"""Numerical regression tests for the mpmath L-function backend in
`kernel.probe()`.

These pin the actual numbers the backend writes to the append-only
ledger, so a future refactor (precision change, Euler-factor rewrite,
mpmath bump) can't silently shift what gets recorded.

Cases covered:
  * `probe(1, 1, 0.5, 14.134725)` — first nontrivial zero of ζ.
    Tag `MPMATH_ZETA`, `|L| < 1e-6`.
  * `probe(1, 1, 2, 0)` — ζ(2) = π²/6. Tag `MPMATH_ZETA`,
    `|L - π²/6| < 1e-10`.
  * `probe(1, 19, 0.5, 0)` — principal Dirichlet character mod 19.
    Tag `MPMATH_DIRICHLET_TRIVIAL`; the prime-19 Euler factor is
    stripped, so the value matches `ζ(0.5) · (1 - 19^{-0.5})`.
  * `probe(2, 547, 0, 0)` — out of scope for the mpmath backend.
    Tag `NEEDS_SAGE` with the documented
    `h>=2_out_of_scope_for_mpmath_backend` reason.

Each test monkeypatches `kernel.HITS` to a throwaway file in `tmp_path`
so the real append-only ledger is never touched.

    `REPO_ROOT/data/hits.txt` (it cannot be redirected via the
