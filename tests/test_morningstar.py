"""Tests that pin the Genesis-seal tamper-evidence guarantees.

These tests assert that:
  * `scripts/check-genesis-seal.py` exits non-zero on byte flips, line
    swaps, and pre-marker insertions in `data/hits.txt`.
  * The unmodified `data/hits.txt` still passes the seal check.
  * `lean_bridge._guard` refuses any rendered Lean text containing
    `axiom `, `sorry`, or `admit ` (defence-in-depth against template
    tampering), and `_genesis_integers` never lifts a non-numeric line
    like `axiom foo` into a generated lemma.
  * `kernel.probe()` aborts (RuntimeError) before any line is appended
    when the Genesis preamble of `data/hits.txt` is tampered.

    Pre-task-#59 hole: `_append_line` took an `fcntl.flock` on its

    `_append_line` entirely and used a plain `read_bytes` +
    `write_bytes` snapshot/restore with no lock at all. A sibling
    appender could land a line between snapshot and restore, and
    the restore would clobber it — `replit.md` called this out as
    a known gotcha.
