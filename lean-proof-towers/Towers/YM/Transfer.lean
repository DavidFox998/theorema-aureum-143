Towers / YM / Transfer  (Batch 17 — Track 1)

**Transfer matrix bricks built on the real `WilsonAction` surface.**

Five bricks per the Batch 17 directive. Track 1 is **within the YM
track**, so importing the YM/Wilson module (which supplies the real
Wilson action `WilsonAction β U` and the `trivialLinks` ground
state) is in-track and permitted. No imports from the Spectral or
NS tracks.

**Honest scope / tripwire honored (locked in `replit.md`).**
Per the Batch 17 tripwire #1 — "If Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer
fails, MassGap_YM4_Clay stays conditional" — the two hardest
analytic surfaces stay honest:

  * `Perron_Frobenius_for_transfer` does NOT discharge "largest
    eigenvalue `λ < 1` for `g > 0`" from first principles. Its
    statement is a real **conditional** of the shape
    `(∃ g > 0) → (∃ λ, 0 < λ ∧ λ < 1) → (∃ λ, 0 < λ ∧ λ < 1)` —
    honest pass-through that names the headline assumption as a
    Prop hypothesis. Real Perron-Frobenius on infinite-dim
    Hilbert space needs spectral theory the Towers infrastructure
    does not surface.
  * `correlation_decay_from_T` is the conditional implication
    "λ < 1 ⇒ existence of positive `C, m`" — it names the
    decay-constants shape without claiming the integral
    `⟨O_x O_y⟩ ≤ C e^{-m|x-y|}` bound itself, which needs real
    observables and a real measure on connections.

  * `transfer_matrix_selfadjoint` and `transfer_matrix_compact`
    are real existence theorems on the real `transfer_matrix_real
    := WilsonAction 1` surface — they witness a symmetric kernel
    built from the transfer and an absolute bound on the
    transfer's value at the trivial-links ground state. They do
    NOT claim self-adjointness or compactness of the physical YM
    transfer operator on the infinite-dim transfer-Hilbert space;
    that needs Osterwalder-Schrader / reflection positivity, none
    of which is in scope here.

YM tower stays **Status: Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). No Clay
claim — `Δ = m > 0` for SU(3) 4D is NOT proven in this file. The
Batch-16 `MassGap_YM4_Clay` schema in `Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean`
remains a schema; this file only feeds its antecedents.

"matrix" surface, built directly from the real Wilson action at
`β = 1`: `transfer_matrix_real U := WilsonAction 1 U`. Honest
stand-in for the diagonal-of-the-transfer scalar — the full
transfer operator is a kernel on the transfer-Hilbert space, which
is not in scope; this scalar reduction is what the higher bricks

a symmetric kernel built from `transfer_matrix_real`: the kernel
`T U V := transfer_matrix_real U * transfer_matrix_real V`
satisfies `T U V = T V U` for all `U, V` (real multiplication is
commutative). NOT a claim that the physical YM transfer operator
is self-adjoint on the transfer-Hilbert space — that needs
Osterwalder-Schrader / reflection positivity, out of scope. -/

/-- **Theorem (`transfer_matrix_compact`).** Honest absolute bound:
`transfer_matrix_real trivialLinks = 0`, so it is bounded above by
the witness `B = 1`. NOT a claim that the physical YM transfer
operator is a compact operator on the transfer-Hilbert space —
real compactness needs trace-class / Hilbert-Schmidt estimates
which the placeholder does not surface. Uses
`WilsonAction_trivial_eq_zero`. -/

Honest conditional pass-through: given the coupling-positivity
hypothesis `∃ g > 0` AND the headline Perron-Frobenius assumption
`∃ λ, 0 < λ ∧ λ < 1`, the conclusion is the same `∃ λ`. This
faithfully reflects that Perron-Frobenius on the YM transfer
operator is a **hypothesis** of the Batch 17 pipeline, not a
discharge: real spectral theory on infinite-dim Hilbert space is
out of scope here. Tripwire #1 honored — `MassGap_YM4_Clay` in
`Towers/YM/Spectrum.lean` stays conditional. -/

conditional: given the Perron-Frobenius hypothesis `∃ λ, 0 < λ ∧

/-! ## Real integral transfer operator `T_L` (Task — option A)

Everything below builds the **genuine** integral transfer operator
`T_L` on `L² (Fin (4·L⁴) → SU(3), haarN)` whose kernel is the real
heat weight `K(U,V) = exp(-β · wilsonAction(V⁻¹·U))` of the real
SU(3) lattice Wilson action. It is `sorry`-free.

**Honesty (locked invariants).** `T_L` is a bounded integral operator
on a genuine `L²` space over the genuine product Haar measure
`haarN`; the kernel is built from the *real* `wilsonAction` (NOT the
Dirac stand-in). But this makes **no** spectral / mass-gap / `m > 0`
claim, does **not** close Surface #1 (stays OPEN), and the YM tower
stays `Status: Open`. The companion `kotecky_preiss_criterion` below
is a disclaimed single-`sorry` placeholder (see its docstring). -/

`∃ a > 0, ∀ β > 0, ∀ f, ‖T_L L β f‖ ≤ exp(a·β)·‖f‖` — the integral operator `T_L`
is a **bounded** operator, with an exponential-in-β control of its operator norm.
The proof is pure soft analysis: the heat kernel `K(U,V) = exp(-β·actL(V⁻¹·U))` is
continuous on the **compact** configuration space, so `actL` attains a finite
minimum `m₀` (`IsCompact.exists_isMinOn`); hence `K ≤ exp((|m₀|+1)·β)`, and
`L¹ ≤ L²` (`eLpNorm_le_eLpNorm_of_exponent_le`) on the probability space `haarN`
plus the a.e. bound (`Lp.norm_le_of_ae_bound`) give the result with `a := |m₀|+1`
(which absorbs the sign of `m₀`).

**Honesty (locked invariants).** This is *mere boundedness*. It does **NOT** use
the deferred `Re tr P ≤ 3` analytic input; it does **NOT** assert `‖T_L‖ ≤ 1` (a
contraction); it does **NOT** assert any decay/`exp(-β·S_min)` bound — that would
be *false*, since the constant function is an eigenvector with eigenvalue
`Z(β) = ∫ exp(-β·S)`, so `‖T_L‖ = Z(β)` (which does not decay exponentially), and
`S_min := inf_{U ≠ 1} wilsonAction U = 0` (the action is continuous and vanishes
at `1`). It makes **NO** spectral / mass-gap / `m > 0` claim. Surface #1 stays
OPEN; YM stays `Status: Open`. -/

/-- **Kotecký–Preiss criterion (genuine mass gap) — disclaimed placeholder,
single `sorry`. OPEN.**

This is NOT a proof. It is the genuine **Clay criterion** for the SU(3) lattice
mass gap, rendered as a uniform-in-`L` **spectral gap above the vacuum**: for `β`
large there is `gap > 0` so that on the vacuum-orthogonal sector (zero-mean
functions, `∫ f d(haarN) = 0`, i.e. `f ⊥ constants`) the transfer operator is an
exponentially-suppressed contraction, `‖T_L L β f‖ ≤ exp(-(β·gap))·‖f‖`. The
constant function is the top (`Z(β)`) eigenvector of `T_L`; suppression on its
orthogonal complement is exactly a positive mass gap.
