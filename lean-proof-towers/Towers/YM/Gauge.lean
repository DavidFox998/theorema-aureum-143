  **This file does NOT prove the Yang-Mills mass gap or any energy
  bound.** It establishes the most-trivial-possible gauge-action
  identity on a single-point trivial bundle and pins the Clay
  mass-gap statement schema as a future target. The single-point
  trivial bundle is NOT a physically meaningful Yang-Mills
  configuration.

  Status (cf. `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2. Yang-Mills mass gap):

  - `TrivialConfiguration G`         — a single-field structure
                                        carrying just the value of a
                                        "connection" at the single
                                        base point of a trivial
                                        principal `G`-bundle over a
                                        point. **Honesty note:** a
                                        real Yang-Mills connection is
                                        a Lie-algebra-valued 1-form
                                        on a principal bundle; this
                                        encoding is a placeholder
                                        scaffold, not a physical
                                        configuration.
  - `instance : MulAction G (TrivialConfiguration G)`
                                     — the gauge action of `G` on
                                        configurations by left
                                        multiplication on the carried
                                        value.
  - `gauge_action_one_smul`          — trivial identity-acts-trivially
                                        lemma, **proved** by delegating
                                        to mathlib's `one_smul`. Axiom
                                        footprint = subset of mathlib's
                                        classical core
                                        `{propext, Classical.choice,
                                        Quot.sound}`, no research-grade
                                        axioms. (Verified by
                                        `scripts/check-towers.sh`.)
  - `gauge_action_mul_smul`          — trivial composition-of-gauge
                                        -transformations lemma,
                                        **proved** by delegating to
                                        mathlib's `mul_smul`. Same
                                        axiom-footprint guarantee.

  **The Clay Yang-Mills mass-gap statement schema has been moved to
  the sibling file `Towers/YM/MassGap.lean`** as a `sorry`-backed
  `def`. That file is deliberately NOT a brick (it ships with
  `sorryAx` by design) and is excluded from `BRICKS` in
  `scripts/check-towers.sh`. This file (`Towers.YM.Gauge`) is
  now **MulAction-only**: no placeholder axioms, no schema, no
  `sorry`.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This file does **not** advance the YM
  tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). It moves YM
  from `Status: Open` to `Status: Open — first/second brick
  formalized (gauge-action identities in Lean, axiom footprint ⊆
  classical trio)`. No promotion past `Open`. No claim of any QFT
  result.

/-- **Trivial-bundle configuration.** A "connection" on the trivial
    principal `G`-bundle over a single point is just a choice of
    element of `G` at that one base point.

    **Honesty note.** A real Yang-Mills connection is a
    Lie-algebra-valued 1-form on a principal bundle over (at least)
    a 4-manifold. This single-field structure is a scaffold for a
    brick name, not a physically meaningful Yang-Mills configuration.
    Future plans must replace this with the real bundle/connection
    machinery once mathlib v4.12.0+ provides it (principal bundles,
    connections, curvature 2-forms, Yang-Mills functional). -/

/-- The **gauge action** of `G` on `TrivialConfiguration G` is by
    left multiplication on the carried value: a gauge transformation

    configuration carrying `g * A`. -/

/-- **Identity gauge transformation acts trivially (trivial brick).**

    For any topological group `G` and any configuration
    `A : TrivialConfiguration G`, the identity gauge transformation
    `(1 : G)` fixes `A`:

      `(1 : G) • A = A`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's `one_smul` on
    the `MulAction` instance above. This lemma is **not** new
    mathematics — it is the `MulAction.one_smul` axiom of any
    group action, re-named in the Yang-Mills context so future
    YM plans have a stable hook to invoke instead of dropping into
    the raw `MulAction` API.

    `scripts/check-towers.sh`). No research-grade axioms. -/

/-- **Composition of gauge transformations (trivial second brick).**

    For any group `G`, any two gauge transformations `g h : G`, and
    any configuration `A : TrivialConfiguration G`, applying the
    composite gauge transformation `g * h` is the same as applying
    `h` first and then `g`:

      `(g * h) • A = g • (h • A)`.

    The proof is a one-line delegation to mathlib's `_root_.mul_smul`
    on the `MulAction` instance above. This lemma is **not** new
    mathematics — it is the `MulAction.mul_smul` axiom of any group
    action, re-named in the Yang-Mills context so future YM plans
    have a stable hook to invoke instead of dropping into the raw
    `MulAction` API.
