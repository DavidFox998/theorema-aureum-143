Towers / YM / Spectrum  (Batch 8 Track 3)

**From "`YMHamiltonian` non-zero" to "`YMHamiltonian` has a
gap-above-vacuum schema".** Five bricks named exactly per the
Batch 8 directive:

  1. `YMHamiltonian_image_nonzero` — `∃ A, YMHamiltonian A ≠ 0`.
     Witness `A = (fun _ => 1)`, closes via the existing Task #55
     `YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve` and `(12 : ℝ) ≠ 0`.
  2. `YMHamiltonian_image_bounded` — `∃ B, ∀ A, |YMHamiltonian A|
     ≤ B`. Witness `B = 12`, closes via the existing Task #61
     `YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`.
  3. `YMHamiltonian_image_has_inf` —
     `BddBelow (Set.range YMHamiltonian) ∧
      (Set.range YMHamiltonian).Nonempty`. Both via Brick 1 / 2.
     Lets downstream callers name `sInf (Set.range YMHamiltonian)`
     without `Classical.choice` on an empty / unbounded set.
  4. `YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def` — pins the "vacuum connection"
     `vacuum_connection := fun _ : Fin 4 => (1 : SU(3))` to the
     numerical value `YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection = 12`. The
     vacuum is the only `SU3Connection` for which the schema
     gives a concrete numerical value.
  5. `YMHamiltonian_gap_above_vacuum_schema` — positivity
     projection of the new `MassGapV2 Δ` predicate, which
     measures the gap *above the vacuum value*
     (`|YMHamiltonian A − YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection|`)
     rather than the absolute value (the existing Task #68
     `MassGap` measures `|YMHamiltonian A|`, which is wrong
     physics — the gap is measured from the vacuum). The brick
     proves `MassGapV2 Δ → 0 < Δ`.

Plus supporting:

  * `vacuum_connection : SU3Connection` — the all-ones connection
    `fun _ : Fin 4 => (1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ)`.
    Honest stand-in for the OS-reconstructed YM vacuum; the
    smallest-trace-stand-in vacuum the current placeholder schema
    admits.
  * `MassGapV2 Δ : Prop` — gap-above-vacuum predicate
    `0 < Δ ∧ ∀ A ≠ vacuum_connection, Δ ≤ |YMHamiltonian A −
    YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection|`. Successor to the Task #68
    `MassGap` predicate.

### Honest scope

What this file claims:

  * Genuine `∃` / `∀` statements about the image of the Task #51 /
    Task #55 / Task #61 placeholder `YMHamiltonian : SU3Connection
    → ℝ`. They are real facts about a real `ℝ`-valued function on
    `Fin 4 → Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ`.
  * `vacuum_connection` is the literal all-ones SU(3) connection.
  * `YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def` is the literal identity
    `YMHamiltonian (fun _ => 1) = 12`, packaged under a named
    "vacuum" handle.
  * `YMHamiltonian_gap_above_vacuum_schema` is the positivity
    projection of `MassGapV2`. The unconditional claim
    `∃ Δ > 0, MassGapV2 Δ` is **NOT** proved in this file (and
    would require either a non-trivial lower bound on
    `|YMHamiltonian A − 12|` away from the vacuum or a refined
    `YMHamiltonian` def — neither is in scope for this batch).

What this file does NOT claim:

  * Existence of a Yang-Mills mass gap;
  * Any spectral theorem on the YM physical-state Hilbert space;
  * `vacuum_connection` is the physical YM vacuum (it isn't — the
    OS-reconstructed physical vacuum is in a different Hilbert
    space entirely);
  * Any Clay-style result.

YM tower status unchanged: **Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2).

### Zero shared imports

This file imports only `Towers.YM.MassGap` (which carries the
existing `SU3Connection`, `YMHamiltonian`, `YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve`,
`YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve` foundation). It does NOT import
`Towers.Spectral.OperatorV2` or `Towers.NS.EnergyV2` — the other
two Batch 8 tracks are independent and run in parallel.

/-! ### Supporting defs -/

/-- **`vacuum_connection`** — the all-ones SU(3) connection
`fun _ : Fin 4 => (1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ)`.
Honest stand-in for the OS-reconstructed YM vacuum; the only
`SU3Connection` on which the placeholder schema gives a concrete
numerical value (`= 12` via Task #55's
`YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve`). -/
def vacuum_connection : SU3Connection :=
  fun _ : Fin 4 => (1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ)

/-- **`MassGapV2 Δ`** — gap-above-vacuum predicate. Successor to
the Task #68 `MassGap`, which measured `|YMHamiltonian A|`
(wrong physics — the gap is measured from the vacuum). Here the
gap is the absolute difference from the vacuum value:

  `0 < Δ ∧ ∀ A ≠ vacuum_connection,
     Δ ≤ |YMHamiltonian A − YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection|`. -/
def MassGapV2 (Δ : ℝ) : Prop :=
  0 < Δ ∧ ∀ A : SU3Connection, A ≠ vacuum_connection →
    Δ ≤ |YMHamiltonian A - YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection|

/-! ### Bricks (5) — exact names per Batch 8 directive -/

/-- **Brick 1 (`YMHamiltonian_image_nonzero`).**
`∃ A, YMHamiltonian A ≠ 0`. The all-ones SU(3) connection
evaluates to `12` via Task #55's `YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve`,
and `(12 : ℝ) ≠ 0`. First time the schema is shown to have
non-zero image. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_image_nonzero :
    ∃ A : SU3Connection, YMHamiltonian A ≠ 0 := by
  refine ⟨fun _ : Fin 4 => (1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ), ?_⟩
  rw [YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve]
  norm_num

/-- **Brick 2 (`YMHamiltonian_image_bounded`).**
`∃ B, ∀ A, |YMHamiltonian A| ≤ B`. Promotes the per-`A` Task #61
bound `YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve` to an `∃` over `A`, naming
`B = 12` as a uniform witness. The image of `YMHamiltonian` is
a bounded subset of `[-12, 12]`. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_image_bounded :
    ∃ B : ℝ, ∀ A : SU3Connection, |YMHamiltonian A| ≤ B :=
  ⟨12, YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve⟩

/-- **Brick 3 (`YMHamiltonian_image_has_inf`).**
`BddBelow (Set.range YMHamiltonian) ∧
 (Set.range YMHamiltonian).Nonempty`. The lower bound is `-12`
via `abs_le.mp` on `YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`; the non-empty
witness is the all-ones connection at value `12`. Lets downstream
callers name `sInf (Set.range YMHamiltonian)` without
`Classical.choice` on an empty / unbounded set. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_image_has_inf :
    BddBelow (Set.range YMHamiltonian) ∧
      (Set.range YMHamiltonian).Nonempty := by
  refine ⟨⟨-12, ?_⟩, ?_⟩
  · rintro y ⟨A, rfl⟩
    have h := YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve A
    exact (abs_le.mp h).1
  · refine ⟨12, ?_⟩
    exact ⟨fun _ : Fin 4 => (1 : Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin 3) ℂ),
           YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve⟩

/-- **Brick 4 (`YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def`).** Pins the numerical
value of the placeholder Hamiltonian at the named vacuum:
`YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection = 12`. Closes by direct
rewrite against Task #55's `YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve` — the
def of `vacuum_connection` is `fun _ => 1`, so the two sides are
literally the same expression.

Honest scope: `vacuum_connection` is NOT the OS-reconstructed YM
vacuum (a different Hilbert space). It is the smallest-trace
SU(3) stand-in vacuum the current placeholder schema admits. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def :
    YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection = 12 :=
  YMHamiltonian_one_eq_twelve

/-- **Brick 5 (`YMHamiltonian_gap_above_vacuum_schema`).**
Positivity projection of the new `MassGapV2` predicate:
`MassGapV2 Δ → 0 < Δ`. Together with `MassGapV2`'s definition,
this brick pins the *shape* of "gap above the vacuum" without
claiming any particular `Δ` has a witness.

Honest scope: this is a `And.left` projection — the unconditional
claim `∃ Δ > 0, MassGapV2 Δ` is **NOT** proved in this file and
would require either a non-trivial lower bound on
`|YMHamiltonian A − 12|` away from the vacuum, or a refined
`YMHamiltonian` def. Neither is in scope for this batch. YM
tower status unchanged: **Open**. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_gap_above_vacuum_schema
    {Δ : ℝ} (h : MassGapV2 Δ) : 0 < Δ := h.1

/-! ### Batch 9 (5) — vacuum-attained inf + MassGapV2 algebra

Five more bricks on the Batch 8 `MassGapV2` / `YMHamiltonian` /
`vacuum_connection` surface. Two name the vacuum-value side of the
"placeholder spectrum"; two are pure algebra on the `MassGapV2`
predicate (positivity, monotone-in-Δ); one is the `0 ≤ Δ`
projection schema.

**Honest scope.** None of these advance the YM tower past
`Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). They prove only:

  * `YMHamiltonian_inf_eq_twelve` — `sInf {YMHamiltonian
    vacuum_connection} = 12`, i.e. `sInf` of the **singleton**
    `{12}`. NOT the infimum of the full image
    `Set.range YMHamiltonian` (that infimum is `-12`, not `12`).
  * `YMHamiltonian_attains_inf` — `∃ A, YMHamiltonian A = 12`
    (witness `vacuum_connection`). Stand-in for "the placeholder
    value `12` is attained", not "the YM Hamiltonian achieves its
    spectral infimum at the vacuum".
  * `MassGap_v2_zero_iff` — `MassGapV2 0 ↔ False`. Pure logic on
    the positivity component of the predicate.
  * `MassGap_v2_monotone` — `MassGapV2 Δ₁ → Δ₂ ≤ Δ₁ → 0 < Δ₂ →
    MassGapV2 Δ₂`. Pure algebra: a lower bound at `Δ₁` is still a
    lower bound at any smaller positive `Δ₂`.
  * `spectrum_gap_schema` — `MassGapV2 Δ → 0 ≤ Δ`. Non-strict
    projection (companion to `YMHamiltonian_gap_above_vacuum_schema`,
    which gives the strict `0 < Δ`). -/

/-- **Brick (`YMHamiltonian_inf_eq_twelve`).** The `sInf` of the
singleton set `{YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection}` equals `12`.
Via `YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def` (the singleton is `{12}`) then
`csInf_singleton`. **Honest scope.** This is `sInf {12} = 12`,
NOT `sInf (Set.range YMHamiltonian) = 12` — the latter is
**FALSE** (the range is bounded below by `-12` via
`YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`, with `-12` attained by `-1`-trace
SU(3) components). The brick names the vacuum value's
singleton-infimum, not the full spectral infimum. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_inf_eq_twelve :
    sInf ({YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection} : Set ℝ) = 12 := by
  rw [YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def]
  exact csInf_singleton 12

/-- **Brick (`YMHamiltonian_attains_inf`).** The placeholder value
`12` is attained by `YMHamiltonian` on `vacuum_connection`:
`∃ A : SU3Connection, YMHamiltonian A = 12`. Witness
`vacuum_connection` via `YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def`. Honest scope:
this says only that `12` is in the range; it does NOT say `12`
is the spectral infimum (the range infimum is `-12`, not `12`). -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_attains_inf :
    ∃ A : SU3Connection, YMHamiltonian A = 12 :=
  ⟨vacuum_connection, YMHamiltonian_vacuum_def⟩

/-- **Brick (`MassGap_v2_zero_iff`).** `MassGapV2 0 ↔ False`. The
positivity component of `MassGapV2` requires `0 < Δ`, so `Δ = 0`
contradicts it; conversely `False` implies anything. Pure logic
on the predicate's first conjunct. Honest scope: this is a
falsity proof for the degenerate `Δ = 0` case, not a non-existence
proof for any `Δ > 0`. -/
theorem MassGap_v2_zero_iff : MassGapV2 0 ↔ False := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    exact lt_irrefl 0 h.1
  · intro h
    exact h.elim

/-- **Brick (`MassGap_v2_monotone`).** If `MassGapV2 Δ₁` holds and
`0 < Δ₂ ≤ Δ₁`, then `MassGapV2 Δ₂` also holds. Pure algebra:
the universal lower bound `Δ₁ ≤ |YMHamiltonian A − 12|` for
non-zero `ψ` implies the weaker `Δ₂ ≤ |YMHamiltonian A − 12|` by
transitivity through `Δ₂ ≤ Δ₁`. Honest scope: this is monotone-
in-Δ algebra on the predicate, NOT a sharpness or attainment
result. -/
theorem MassGap_v2_monotone {Δ₁ Δ₂ : ℝ}
    (h : MassGapV2 Δ₁) (hle : Δ₂ ≤ Δ₁) (hpos : 0 < Δ₂) :
    MassGapV2 Δ₂ := by
  refine ⟨hpos, ?_⟩
  intro A hne
  exact hle.trans (h.2 A hne)

/-- **Brick (`spectrum_gap_schema`).** Non-strict version of
`YMHamiltonian_gap_above_vacuum_schema`: `MassGapV2 Δ → 0 ≤ Δ`.
Via `le_of_lt` on `h.1`. Honest scope: schema-level projection,
NOT an existence claim — does NOT prove `∃ Δ ≥ 0, MassGapV2 Δ`
nor any positive lower bound on `|YMHamiltonian A − 12|`. -/
theorem spectrum_gap_schema {Δ : ℝ} (h : MassGapV2 Δ) : 0 ≤ Δ :=
  le_of_lt h.1

/-! ### Batch 10 (5) — infrared-bound / OS-reconstruction setup

Five bricks naming the YM-side prerequisites for Osterwalder-Schrader
reconstruction: coercivity of the placeholder Hamiltonian, the
essentially-self-adjoint schema (the unbounded extension step in OS),
positivity of the vacuum gap (the Clay statement projected to the
placeholder), cluster decomposition (factorisation of vacuum
expectations at large separation), and infrared regularisation (the
volume / mass cutoff that makes the YM functional integral
well-defined).

**Honest scope.** YM tower stays **Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2).
The `_schema` bricks are NAMED Prop predicates; none are proved.
`YMHamiltonian_coercive` is a real theorem (the placeholder
Hamiltonian is bounded below by `-12` via Task #61's
`YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`). `infrared_regularization` is a
schema def naming the volume / mass-cutoff coupling. -/

/-- **Brick (`YMHamiltonian_coercive`).** The placeholder Hamiltonian
is bounded below by `-12` on the whole `SU3Connection` space:
`∀ A, -12 ≤ YMHamiltonian A`. Closes via `abs_le.mp` on Task #61's
`YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`. Honest scope: this is *coercivity
with bound `-12`*, NOT coercivity in the spectral sense
(`⟨H ψ, ψ⟩ ≥ c ‖ψ‖²` for `c > 0`) — that would require an inner
product on the connection space and a non-trivial `H`. The brick
supplies the *lower bound* coercivity needs, on the placeholder. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_coercive :
    ∀ A : SU3Connection, -12 ≤ YMHamiltonian A := by
  intro A
  have h := YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve A
  exact (abs_le.mp h).1

/-- **Schema (`YMHamiltonian_essentially_selfadjoint_schema`).**
Named Prop predicate for essential self-adjointness of an unbounded
extension of `YMHamiltonian`: the densely-defined symmetric operator
has a unique self-adjoint extension. On the placeholder (where
`YMHamiltonian : SU3Connection → ℝ` is already a function, not an
operator) this is rendered as the implication
`(∀ A B, YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian B → A = B) → ∀ A, ∃! B,
YMHamiltonian B = YMHamiltonian A` — the "injective ⇒ uniquely
invertible" *shape*. Real Prop over real arithmetic; the
implication is NOT proved here. Honest scope: this NAMES the OS
reconstruction step, NOT the self-adjoint extension theorem. -/
def YMHamiltonian_essentially_selfadjoint_schema : Prop :=
  (∀ A B : SU3Connection, YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian B → A = B) →
    ∀ A : SU3Connection, ∃! B : SU3Connection,
      YMHamiltonian B = YMHamiltonian A

/-- **Schema (`vacuum_gap_positive_schema`).** Named Prop predicate
for the Clay YM mass-gap statement, projected to the placeholder:
"there exists `Δ > 0` such that `MassGapV2 Δ` holds." This is the
Clay conjecture's shape on the present placeholder surface — and
is **NOT proved** here. The schema honestly admits we don't have it:
the predicate is exactly `∃ Δ : ℝ, MassGapV2 Δ`, leaving the
existence claim as a future obligation. Honest scope: YM mass gap
stays **Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2); this brick names the
existence target without supplying a witness. -/
def vacuum_gap_positive_schema : Prop :=
  ∃ Δ : ℝ, MassGapV2 Δ

/-- **Schema (`cluster_decomposition_schema`).** Named Prop predicate
for cluster decomposition: vacuum expectations of products of
spatially-separated observables factorise as the separation tends
to infinity. On the placeholder this is rendered as the implication
`(A = vacuum_connection ∧ B = vacuum_connection) →
YMHamiltonian A * YMHamiltonian B = YMHamiltonian A *
YMHamiltonian B` — a trivial reflexivity over the placeholder
"observables" `YMHamiltonian A`, `YMHamiltonian B`. Real Prop;
**NOT** the real cluster-decomposition theorem (which requires
Schwinger functions and an Euclidean QFT). Honest schema. -/
def cluster_decomposition_schema (A B : SU3Connection) : Prop :=
  (A = vacuum_connection ∧ B = vacuum_connection) →
    YMHamiltonian A * YMHamiltonian B =
      YMHamiltonian A * YMHamiltonian B

/-- **Schema (`infrared_regularization`).** Named schema def for
the volume / mass-cutoff regularisation the YM functional integral
needs to be well-defined: `infrared_regularization Λ μ A := A` for
all `Λ μ`, i.e. the regularisation is the identity on the
placeholder connection (no real cutoff applied). Reserves the slot
for a future `(Λ, μ) ↦ ProjectedConnection` def once a real
infrared cutoff (compact spatial volume `Λ`, infrared mass `μ`)
is in scope. Honest scope: NOT a real regularisation; identity
placeholder. -/
def infrared_regularization (_Λ _μ : ℝ) (A : SU3Connection) :
    SU3Connection :=
  A

/-! ### Batch 11 (5) — Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction track

Five bricks that promote the Batch 10 OS scaffolding one step toward
a reconstruction theorem:

  1. `YMHamiltonian_selfadjoint` — combinator: from the injectivity
     hypothesis of Batch 10's `YMHamiltonian_essentially_selfadjoint_
     schema`, derive the unique-inverse conclusion. Real proof using
     `ExistsUnique.intro`. Honest scope: this is the *elimination*
     form of the schema; NOT a proof of essential self-adjointness
     of any real YM operator.
  2. `OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema` — NAMED Prop schema for the
     full OS axiom bundle (Euclidean invariance, reflection
     positivity, regularity, cluster). On the placeholder this is
     rendered as a conjunction of trivially-true reflexivity Props
     parameterised over `SU3Connection`. NOT proved at the real OS
     level; honest schema.
  3. `Wightman_functions_from_OS_schema` — schema combinator: from
     `OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema A`, produce the *named*
     conclusion `OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema A` (the schema
     is its own elimination on the placeholder). Real Prop bridge
     naming the OS → Wightman reconstruction step; NOT the
     reconstruction theorem itself.
  4. `cluster_implies_mass_gap_schema` — schema combinator: from
     `cluster_decomposition_schema A B` AND `vacuum_gap_positive_
     schema`, produce `vacuum_gap_positive_schema`. Real Prop
     bridge naming the cluster → mass-gap step; NOT a proof of
     mass gap from cluster decomposition.
  5. `vacuum_expectation_bounded` — REAL theorem: `|YMHamiltonian
     vacuum_connection| ≤ 12`. Closes via Task #61's
     `YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve`. Honest scope: this is the
     placeholder vacuum expectation, bounded by Task #61's
     uniform bound; NOT a real vacuum expectation value bound.

**Tripwire active (directive Track 3).** Since `YMHamiltonian_
selfadjoint` is a combinator that takes the injectivity hypothesis
(NOT a proof of injectivity for the placeholder `YMHamiltonian`),
the OS-axiom track stays schema-only:
`OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema`, `Wightman_functions_from_OS_
schema`, and `cluster_implies_mass_gap_schema` are all Prop-level
predicates and combinators with no real OS / Wightman / mass-gap
existence claim. YM tower stays **Open** (`docs/ROADMAP.md` § 2). -/

/-- **Brick (`YMHamiltonian_selfadjoint`).** Combinator: from the
injectivity hypothesis `∀ A B, YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian B →
A = B` (the antecedent of Batch 10's
`YMHamiltonian_essentially_selfadjoint_schema`), derive the
unique-inverse conclusion `∀ A, ∃! B, YMHamiltonian B = YMHamiltonian
A`. Real proof: take `B := A`, the existence witness is `rfl`, and
uniqueness follows from the injectivity hypothesis applied to any
other `B'` with `YMHamiltonian B' = YMHamiltonian A`. Honest scope:
this is the *elimination form* of the schema (schema → conclusion
via injectivity); NOT a proof of essential self-adjointness of any
real unbounded YM operator. Directive tripwire: if the caller cannot
supply the injectivity hypothesis, the conclusion is unreachable. -/
theorem YMHamiltonian_selfadjoint
    (h_inj : ∀ A B : SU3Connection,
      YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian B → A = B) :
    ∀ A : SU3Connection, ∃! B : SU3Connection,
      YMHamiltonian B = YMHamiltonian A := by
  intro A
  refine ⟨A, rfl, ?_⟩
  intro B hB
  exact h_inj B A hB

/-- **Schema (`OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema`).** Named Prop
predicate for the OS axiom bundle (Euclidean invariance, reflection
positivity, regularity, cluster). On the placeholder this is
rendered as a four-fold conjunction of trivially-true reflexivity
Props parameterised over `SU3Connection`. Real Prop; NOT a proof
of the full OS axioms (which would require Schwinger functions on
an Euclidean QFT, out of scope on the placeholder). Honest schema. -/
def OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema (A : SU3Connection) : Prop :=
  YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian A ∧
    YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian A ∧
    YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian A ∧
    YMHamiltonian A = YMHamiltonian A

/-- **Brick (`Wightman_functions_from_OS_schema`).** Schema
combinator: from `OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema A`, produce the
*same* `OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema A`. Real Prop bridge
naming the OS → Wightman reconstruction step; on the placeholder the
two surfaces collapse to the same conjunction. Honest scope: NOT a
proof of the OS reconstruction theorem (which would produce
Wightman distributions from Schwinger functions); identity bridge
on the placeholder. Directive tripwire: if the caller cannot supply
`OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema A`, the conclusion is
unreachable. -/
theorem Wightman_functions_from_OS_schema (A : SU3Connection)
    (h_os : OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema A) :
    OsterwalderSchrader_axioms_schema A :=
  h_os

/-- **Brick (`cluster_implies_mass_gap_schema`).** Schema combinator:
from `cluster_decomposition_schema A B` AND
`vacuum_gap_positive_schema`, produce `vacuum_gap_positive_schema`
(the second hypothesis is the conclusion — identity bridge naming
the cluster → mass-gap step). Real Prop; NOT a proof that cluster
decomposition implies the YM mass gap (which is the real
content of the Glimm-Jaffe-Spencer programme). Directive tripwire:
the brick requires the caller already supply
`vacuum_gap_positive_schema`, so the YM mass-gap existence stays
**Open**. -/
theorem cluster_implies_mass_gap_schema (A B : SU3Connection)
    (_h_cluster : cluster_decomposition_schema A B)
    (h_gap : vacuum_gap_positive_schema) :
    vacuum_gap_positive_schema :=
  h_gap

/-- **Brick (`vacuum_expectation_bounded`).** Real theorem:
`|YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection| ≤ 12`. Direct application of
Task #61's `YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve` to the vacuum connection.
Honest scope: this is the placeholder "vacuum expectation value" of
the YM Hamiltonian, bounded by Task #61's uniform `|YMHamiltonian
A| ≤ 12` bound; NOT a real vacuum expectation value
`⟨Ω, H_YM Ω⟩` on a YM Hilbert space (which would require Hilbert
space + Hamiltonian + vacuum vector, all out of scope on the
placeholder). -/
theorem vacuum_expectation_bounded :
    |YMHamiltonian vacuum_connection| ≤ 12 :=
  YMHamiltonian_abs_le_twelve vacuum_connection
