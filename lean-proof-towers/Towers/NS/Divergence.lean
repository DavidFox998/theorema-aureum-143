  # Towers.NS.Divergence

  **This file does NOT prove Navier-Stokes global regularity, any
  blow-up criterion, or any energy estimate.** It establishes the
  trivial linearity of the divergence operator on smooth vector
  fields and pins the Clay-formulated global-regularity statement
  as a future target.

  Status (cf. `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3. Navier-Stokes global regularity):

  - `V`                              — abbreviation for the 3D Euclidean
                                        space `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 3)`,
                                        in which we work.
  - `stdBasis i`                     — the `i`-th standard unit vector
                                        of `V`.
  - `divergence v x`                 — minimal definition of the
                                        divergence of a vector field
                                        `v : V → V` at `x : V`, as the
                                        sum of the directional
                                        derivatives along the three
                                        coordinate axes of the
                                        corresponding components.
                                        Built on top of mathlib's
                                        `fderiv`. No fancy distribution
                                        theory; just the elementary
                                        Fréchet derivative.
  - `divergence_add`                 — trivial linearity-under-addition
                                        lemma, **proved**, conditional
                                        on `Differentiable ℝ v` and
                                        `Differentiable ℝ w` (so that
                                        `fderiv_add` applies). Axiom
                                        footprint = subset of mathlib's
                                        classical core
                                        `{propext, Classical.choice,
                                        Quot.sound}`, no research-grade
                                        axioms. (Verified by
                                        `scripts/check-towers.sh`.)
  - `divergence_smul`                — trivial scalar-homogeneity
                                        lemma, **proved**, conditional
                                        on `Differentiable ℝ v` (so that
                                        `fderiv_const_smul` applies).
                                        Same axiom-footprint guarantee.

  **The Clay 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes global-regularity
  statement schema has been moved to the sibling file
  `Towers/NS/EnergyIneq.lean`** as a `sorry`-backed `def`. That
  file is deliberately NOT a brick (it ships with `sorryAx` by
  design) and is excluded from `BRICKS` in
  `scripts/check-towers.sh`. This file (`Towers.NS.Divergence`)
  is now **div-linearity-only**: no placeholder axioms, no
  schema, no `sorry`.

  **Honest scoping reminder.** This file does **not** advance the NS
  tower past `Status: Open` (see `docs/ROADMAP.md` § 3). It moves NS
  from `Status: Open` to `Status: Open — first/second brick
  formalized (divergence-linearity in Lean, axiom footprint ⊆
  classical trio)`. No promotion past `Open`. No claim of any PDE
  result.

/-- **Divergence of a vector field on `ℝ³`** (minimal definition).

    For a vector field `v : V → V` and a point `x : V`, the
    divergence is the sum over the three coordinate axes of the
    `i`-th component of the Fréchet derivative `fderiv ℝ v x`
    applied to the `i`-th standard unit vector:

      `(div v)(x) = ∑ i, (Dᵢ v(x))ᵢ`

    This matches the classical definition `div v = ∂₁v₁ + ∂₂v₂ +
    ∂₃v₃` whenever the component partial derivatives exist. We use
    `fderiv` (rather than a coordinate-wise `deriv`) so we can
    invoke `fderiv_add` directly in the linearity lemma below
    without reaching for `Function.partialDeriv` (which mathlib
    v4.12.0 does not provide under that name).

    No multiplicity-of-zero or distributional theory is invoked.
    This is the elementary divergence on smooth vector fields, and
    nothing more. -/

/-- **Linearity of divergence under addition (trivial brick).**

    For any two `Differentiable ℝ` vector fields `v, w : V → V` and
    any point `x : V`,

      `div (v + w) (x) = div v (x) + div w (x)`.

    The proof is a one-line reduction to mathlib's `fderiv_add`
    plus finite-sum linearity. This lemma is **not** new
    mathematics — it is the trivial linearity of the Fréchet
    derivative wrapped in a divergence-flavoured name so future NS
    plans have a stable hook to invoke instead of dropping into the
    raw `fderiv` API.

/-- **Linearity of divergence under scalar multiplication (trivial second brick).**

    For any real scalar `c : ℝ`, any `Differentiable ℝ` vector field
    `v : V → V`, and any point `x : V`,

      `div (c • v) (x) = c * div v (x)`.

    The proof is a one-line reduction to mathlib's
    `fderiv_const_smul` plus pulling the constant out of a finite
    sum (`Finset.mul_sum`). This lemma is **not** new mathematics —
    it is the trivial scalar-homogeneity of the Fréchet derivative
    wrapped in a divergence-flavoured name so future NS plans have a
    stable hook to invoke instead of dropping into the raw `fderiv`
    API.
