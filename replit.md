## Task #208 — Mathlib build unblock + OS-surface deferral (2026-05-29)

Root cause of the red `towers-build`: `Towers/YM/LatticeGauge.lean`
and `Towers/YM/WilsonAction.lean` had been trimmed to **pure-core**
(zero mathlib imports), which DELETED the `G` (= SU(2)),
`GaugeConfig`, and `plaquette` substrate ("deferred to Wall 570+").
That orphaned every brick standing on it.

Resolution (user-approved, deferral path):

- **Repaired in place (4 modules, no statement change):**
  `SpectralBound` (import → `Mathlib.Analysis.Normed.Algebra.Spectrum`),
  `KoteckyPreiss` (add `import Towers.YM.LatticeGauge` for `Link` +
  `noncomputable polymerWeight`), `PolymerModel` (add `LatticeGauge`
  + `Mathlib.Data.Set.Pairwise.Lattice`, `noncomputable
  polymerWeightReal`, `PairwiseDisjoint` via `Set` coercion),
  `MassGapEnvelope` (`open scoped InnerProductSpace` for `⟪·,·⟫_ℂ`).
  All four verified: `#print axioms` = classical trio.

- **Deferred (24 modules → 29 BRICKS entries removed):** the full
  Osterwalder–Schrader surface (TRI #9–#13: OS-1 reflection
  positivity, OS-2 invariance, OS-3 locality, OS-4 clustering) plus
  the real Kotecký–Preiss / transfer-kernel chain. = 5 direct
  orphans (`LatticeRotation`, `LatticeAction`, `TimeReflection`,
  `Support`, `PlaquetteEnergy`) + 19 transitive importers. Removed
  from `lakefile.lean` roots (99 → 75) and `scripts/check-towers.sh`
  `BRICKS` (545 → 516). The `.lean` files are KEPT on disk for
  re-registration once the `G`/`GaugeConfig`/`plaquette` substrate
  returns at Wall 570+. These bricks made NO mass-gap / μ>0 claim
  (all vacuous `const_one` / Dirac stand-ins) — Surface #1 stays
  OPEN, YM Status Open. No invariant changed.

- **Verified:** direct `lake build Towers` = green (the wiping
  `check-towers.sh` / `towers-build` was NOT run — it `lake update`s
  and re-clones mathlib per the gotcha below).

## Locked invariants (every batch must hold these)

- Axiom footprint = classical trio
  `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`; no new research-grade
  axioms.
- Mathlib v4.12.0 only; no `sorry` / `admit` in any landed brick.
- YM and NS towers stay `Status: Open` in `docs/ROADMAP.md`;
  Surface #1 and Surface #2 stay OPEN. "Surface #1 CLOSED" /
  "μ > 0" / "removes the Attempts sorry" / "Mass Gap proven"
  claims are REFUSED — every YM Measure-surface brick is trivially
  or vacuously true under the Dirac haar stand-in
  (`T_OS = 0` / `T_real = 0`), NOT under any real Wilson transfer
  operator.
- `kotecky_preiss_criterion` remains a `sorry` in
  `Towers/Attempts/ClusterExpansion.lean` (invariant-locked).

## Pending / in-flight (not yet landed)

- **Wall 571-B / [YM1-LB-Core]** — `Towers/YM/LatticePositivity.lean`
  written + VERIFIED (`namespace TheoremaAureum.YM_MassGap`). Pure-core
  (no mathlib, no imports, `Int`/`Nat` only): `lattice_positivity`
  proves a finite sum of integer squares is `≥ 0` and `= 0` iff every
  term is `0` — the trivial discrete shadow of "H ≥ 0", NOTHING more.
  `#print axioms …lattice_positivity` = [] (strictly empty) via direct
  `lean` (lake-free). Registered as [YM1-LB-Core], NOT [YM1]; makes NO
  mass-gap / μ>0 / Surface-#1 claim — Surface #1 stays OPEN, YM Status
  Open. NOT in `scripts/check-towers.sh` BRICKS (that path is
  lake-gated → script-reported wall unchanged). ℝ companion now
  landed as Wall 572 / [YM1-LB-Real] (see next entry).

- **Wall 572 / [YM1-LB-Real]** — `Towers/YM/LatticePositivityReal.lean`
  written + VERIFIED (`namespace TheoremaAureum.YM_MassGap`). ℝ
  companion of Wall 571-B: `hamiltonian_pos` proves, for the IDENTITY
  stand-in `H = 1` on the finite real ℓ² space `PiLp 2 (fun _ : Fin n
  => ℝ)`, that `0 ≤ ⟪ψ, H ψ⟫_ℝ` with equality iff `ψ = 0`
  (`real_inner_self_nonneg` + `inner_self_eq_zero`) — the trivial
  Hilbert-space shadow of "H ≥ 0", NOTHING more. `H` is NOT the
  Wilson / Yang–Mills transfer operator. `#print axioms
  …hamiltonian_pos` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
  (classical trio — accepted criterion, NOT []) via `lake env lean`.
  Registered as [YM1-LB-Real], NOT [YM1]; makes NO mass-gap / μ>0 /
  spectral-gap / Surface-#1 claim — Surface #1 stays OPEN, YM Status
  Open. Real (non-identity) `H` and any gap statement deferred to
  Wall 573. NOT in `scripts/check-towers.sh` BRICKS (lake-gated →
  script-reported wall unchanged). Verify: see the file's
  honest-scope header.

- **Wall 573 / [YM1-GR]** — `Towers/YM/GapReduction.lean` written +
  VERIFIED (`namespace TheoremaAureum.YM_MassGap`). REDUCTION/SCAFFOLD
  ONLY: `gap_reduction` proves that for any `A : H → H` and `m : ℝ`,
  IF `A` is coercive (`hco : ∀ ψ, m * ‖ψ‖^2 ≤ ⟪ψ, A ψ⟫_ℝ`, taken as a
  HYPOTHESIS) THEN `A` is bounded below (`∀ ψ, m * ‖ψ‖ ≤ ‖A ψ‖`) — via
  Cauchy–Schwarz (`real_inner_le_norm`) + `nlinarith`. `A`, `m`, `hco`
  are ALL free variables/hypotheses: this constructs NO Hamiltonian,
  proves NO `m > 0` exists, and proves NO spectral gap — only the
  trivial direction "assumed gap ⟹ bounded below" (operator-level
  shadow of "a gap forbids soft modes"). `#print axioms
  …gap_reduction` = `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`
  (classical trio) via `lake env lean`; no `sorry`. Registered as
  [YM1-GR], NOT [YM1]; makes NO mass-gap / μ>0 / Surface-#1-CLOSED
  claim — Surface #1 stays OPEN, YM Status: Open. The EXISTENCE of `m`
  for the real YM transfer Hamiltonian is the open problem, untouched
  (next: Task #208 to unblock the real `H` construction). NOT in
  `scripts/check-towers.sh` BRICKS (lake-gated → wall unchanged).
  Verify: see the file's honest-scope header.

- **Batch 178.1 / SLinkDef** — `Towers/YM/SLinkDef.lean` written
  (`S_link` + brick `S_link_const_one`), NOT registered to
  `lakefile.lean` / `scripts/check-towers.sh` BRICKS array, no wall
  gain claimed. Verification blocked by the task #208 cache wipe
  (the `lake update` re-clone race). Clean verify sequence once the
  cache is stable: `lake exe cache get` → `lake build Towers`
  (produces dependency oleans incl. `KoteckyPreissRealKP.olean`) →
  `lake env lean Towers/YM/SLinkDef.lean` + `#print axioms
  TheoremaAureum.Towers.YM.LatticeGauge.S_link_const_one`.

## Gotcha — do NOT run `towers-build` / `lake update` casually

The `towers-build` workflow (and any `lake update`) re-clones the
vendored mathlib checkout and wipes its oleans, requiring a
`lake-recovery` (`lake exe cache get`) pass. Verify bricks via
direct `lake env lean <file>` + `#print axioms` instead.
