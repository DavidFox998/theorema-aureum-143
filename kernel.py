"""Layer 4 (Transport) — MorningStar-Lab kernel.

probe(h, N, re_s, im_s) -> dict.

Backend: mpmath (pure-Python arbitrary-precision). What we can actually
compute honestly:

- h == 1, N == 1: Riemann zeta ζ(s). Tag MPMATH_ZETA.
- h == 1, N > 1: principal Dirichlet character χ₀ mod N. We strip the
  Euler factors at primes p|N from ζ(s):
      L(s, χ₀) = ζ(s) · ∏_{p|N} (1 - p^{-s}).
  Tag MPMATH_DIRICHLET_TRIVIAL.
- h >= 2: class-group / modular L-functions are out of scope for the
  mpmath backend. The line is tagged NEEDS_SAGE and L_nonvanish is left
  as a stub (True) — the tag is the contract that says "do not trust
  this number".

Failure modes (overflow, mpmath exception, timeout-by-exception) also
fall back to NEEDS_SAGE with a reason field; the ledger never silently
lies about a backend result.

Append-only invariant: before any write, this module re-verifies the
Genesis preamble of data/hits.txt against the baked-in seal and refuses
to proceed if a single byte has changed. The verification routine is
imported in-process from scripts/check-genesis-seal.py so that the seal
hash has exactly ONE source of truth, while avoiding a ~400ms subprocess
fork on every append. The standalone script and the CLI tamper-evidence
guard (scripts/check-genesis-seal.py invoked from tests/post-merge) are
unchanged.

    """Context manager: take an exclusive `fcntl.flock` on the sidecar
    `HITS_LOCK_FILE` for the duration of the `with` block.

    This is the canonical cross-tool serialization primitive for any
    code that touches `data/hits.txt` — `_append_line` (live probe
    workflows) AND external backup/restore helpers (the
    `morningstar-tamper` snapshot/restore fixture in
    `tests/test_morningstar.py`) all queue on the same lock.

    Why a sidecar and not `flock(HITS)` directly: tamper helpers
    snapshot the ledger, mutate it (often via `os.replace` for
    atomicity against concurrent readers), then restore from the
    snapshot. `os.replace` swaps the inode at the path; any flock
    taken on the *file* HITS would now be orphaned on the old inode,
    and a fresh `open(HITS)` from a sibling probe would see the new
    inode with no contention and slip a line in during the mutate →
    restore window — the restore would then silently overwrite that
    line (task #59). The sidecar lockfile lives on a stable inode
    that no helper replaces, so the lock is durable across atomic
    rewrites of the ledger itself.

    Thread-reentrant within the same process: built on a
    `threading.RLock`, so a tamper fixture that holds the lock and
    then (in the same thread) calls `kernel.probe()` —  which
    internally calls `_append_line()`, which also takes the lock —
    just bumps the recursion counter instead of self-deadlocking.
    A *different* thread in the same process still has to wait for
    the RLock to be released, exactly like a different process
    waits for the flock. So both layers preserve mutual exclusion
    between independent writers; the only "reentrancy" allowed is
    "the same thread re-entering its own critical section".

    The underlying flock is acquired once at outermost entry (depth
    transitions 0 → 1) and released at outermost exit (N → 0), so
    the cross-process serialization contract is unchanged: another
    process's `_append_line` blocks until *our* outermost
    `with kernel.hits_exclusive_lock()` exits.

    On non-POSIX hosts where `fcntl` is unavailable the flock layer
    is a no-op (falls back to the pre-task-#54 behaviour); the
    thread-level RLock still serializes intra-process writers. The
    repo targets Linux, so the fcntl-less path is just defensive.

    the open append handle. Two concurrent appenders (e.g.
    `zeta-burst-101-10000` running alongside
    `zeta-sieve-14159-100000`) therefore queue on the sidecar lock
    instead of racing on the checkpoint refresh —
    `_update_checkpoint` reads the whole file, hashes it, and
    atomically replaces `data/hits.txt.checkpoint`, so without
    serialization writer A can land its line, writer B can append
    its own line, then writer A's `_update_checkpoint` would rehash
    the file (now containing B's line) and stamp it as A's

    `write + flush + fsync + checkpoint` is atomic per line; a
    second writer waits at `flock(LOCK_EX)` until the first fully
    completes. POSIX `O_APPEND` already prevents byte-level tearing
    for short writes (<= `PIPE_BUF`), but the lock is what keeps the
    SHA chain in `hits.txt` and the recorded prefix-hash in
    `hits.txt.checkpoint` consistent.

         with t, |L|, and a dry_run=True marker, but no SHA (no ledger
         line was made, so there is no SHA to publish).

    Honest scope: this is NOT the full Odlyzko-Schönhage FFT trick
    (which computes Z on the full grid in O(M log M) via the
    Riemann-Siegel main sum re-expansion). It is a parallelized
    sign-change sieve over per-point siegelz evaluations, plus a
    refinement pass. The speed win over zetazero(n) sniping comes from
    (a) skipping the per-zero grampoint search, (b) batching the Z
    evaluations across cores, and (c) reusing one grid for all zeros in
    a window. The constant factor is real; the asymptotic improvement
    is not.

    Concurrency contract: `_append_line` takes an exclusive
    `fcntl.flock` on its open append handle, so the full sequence
    `write + flush + fsync + _update_checkpoint` is atomic per line
    against any other process that also goes through `_append_line`
    (i.e. any sibling using the kernel API). Two concurrent appender
    workflows — e.g. `zeta-burst-101-10000` alongside
    `zeta-sieve-14159-100000` — therefore queue at line granularity
    instead of racing on the checkpoint refresh, and the per-line
    SHA chain in `hits.txt` stays internally consistent with the
    recorded prefix hash in `hits.txt.checkpoint`. The Genesis seal
    covers only the preamble (lines 1-9), which appends never touch.
    Lines may still appear out of strict temporal order — fine for an
    append-only sealed ledger.

    What is NOT safe under concurrency: external backup/restore tools
    (e.g. `morningstar-tamper`'s pytest fixture that snapshots
    `hits.txt`, mutates it, then restores from the snapshot). If a
    sibling process appends a line during that mutate-restore window,
    the restore silently overwrites it. Run those tools only when the
    ledger has no other live writer.

    The multiprocessing.Pool workers only compute Z(t) and return
    floats — they never call _append_line.
