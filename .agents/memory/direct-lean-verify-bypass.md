# Verifying a towers brick without `lake` (broken mathlib pin)

When the vendored mathlib `v4.12.0` git tag is unresolved (`git -C
lean-proof-towers/.lake/packages/mathlib rev-parse v4.12.0` fails) AND the
worktree is unhydrated, `lake env lean` re-resolves `inputRev: v4.12.0`, fetches
from remote, and WIPES the oleans. The documented recovery (`restore-lake-git.sh`
×2 + recreate the tag) needs `git checkout` / `git tag`, both BLOCKED for the
main agent. So neither `lake` nor the recovery script is usable by main agent.

**But the oleans usually survive** (`.lake/packages/*/.lake/build/lib` +
`.lake/build/lib` for the local Towers). A new brick only needs mathlib's
*oleans*, not its *source*, to elaborate. So bypass lake entirely:

```bash
cd lean-proof-towers
LP=".lake/build/lib"; for d in .lake/packages/*/.lake/build/lib; do LP="$LP:$d"; done
LEAN_PATH="$LP" lean Towers/YM/<File>.lean      # EXIT=0 == compiles
```

The toolchain `lean`/`lake` are on PATH via elan and are already v4.12.0
(`lean-toolchain` = `leanprover/lean4:v4.12.0`), so the kernel/stdlib match the
oleans. Confirm axioms by appending `#print axioms <FullyQualified.name>` lines
(qualify them — they run after `end namespace`), recompile, then revert.

**Why:** this is the only verification path open to the main agent when the pin
is broken; it is non-destructive (no git, no lake re-resolve, oleans untouched).
**How to apply:** before ANY `lake env lean`, assert the tag resolves; if it
doesn't, use the direct-`lean` path above instead and document the brick as
verified-by-direct-lean (not via `check-towers.sh`, which runs the destructive
`lake build`).

## Gotcha: prebuilt `.lake/build/lib` Towers oleans can be STALE

The Towers oleans in `.lake/build/lib/Towers/**` are NOT auto-rebuilt by the
direct-`lean` path — they persist from whenever `check-towers.sh` / lake last
ran. After a source edit (e.g. the SORRY purge that added new `*_Surface`
defs), the on-disk olean for that module is STALE and lacks the new
declarations. A downstream file that `import`s it then fails with `unknown
identifier '<NewDef>'` even though `open <Namespace>` succeeds (the namespace
loads from the stale olean, but the new name isn't in it) — a confusing
false-negative that looks like a namespace/path bug but is staleness.
**Fix:** recompile each stale DEPENDENCY module to refresh its olean FIRST
(`lean -o .lake/build/lib/Towers/<Path>.olean Towers/<Path>.lean`), in
dependency order, THEN compile the consumer. `open` finding the namespace but
NOT the identifier is the tell-tale sign of a stale dep olean.

## Whole-tower axiom sweep (fast, no source re-elaboration)

To axiom-audit MANY landed bricks at once (e.g. all YM), DON'T re-elaborate each
source file (~1.5 min each). Instead write one temp `.lean` that `import`s the
prebuilt modules and lists `#print axioms <Fully.Qualified.decl>` for every
brick, then run it under the direct-`lean` LEAN_PATH. `#print axioms` only LOADS
oleans (cheap), so hundreds of decls cost ~one olean-load.
**Gotcha — the 2-min bash-tool limit:** importing the WHOLE YM set (76 modules)
in ONE file loads the *union* of their transitive mathlib closures and exceeds
the 2-min timeout. CHUNK the imports (split modules into groups, ~8-20 each) and
run each group separately. The transfer / OS-positivity / spectrum / two-point
modules are the HEAVY ones (a single group of ~8 took ~1m48s); isolate them into
smaller sub-chunks. Aggregate the per-chunk outputs and scan: extract every
`axioms: [...]` body (lists wrap across lines — slurp with `perl -0777`), split
on commas, `sort -u`; a clean tower yields exactly `{propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}` (some decls print "does not depend on any axioms").
